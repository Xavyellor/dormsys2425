Finding suitable dormitories has long been a challenging process for university students in the Philippines. Students and other prospective tenants used to have to look for available apartments physically or depend on scattered sources like Facebook, or online advertisements. This fragmented method makes it difficult to compare options, filter important criteria such as amenities, location, and price, or secure a room promptly. This causes delays and issues for potential tenants and makes it difficult for homeowners or apartment owners to effectively market their properties and handle inquiries. 

The manual approach to arranging appointments for unit viewings, booking dormitory rooms, and handling payments often leads to inefficiencies. Scheduling conflicts, missed opportunities, and frustration is common for both tenants and owners due to the reliance on private messages or phone calls for communication. This disorganized system may hinder the seamless rental process, which is especially problematic for students with limited time and resources.	

In response to these issues, the development of a centralized Dormitory Management System aims to streamline the entire process. This system aims to make renting a better experience by integrating room listings, simplifying booking and payment processes, and improving communication between tenants and owners. By addressing the shortcomings of the conventional method, the suggested alternative provides a more open, effective, and user-friendly platform for student tenants, across different universities in Manila City.
